# Prompt Instructions

This repository contains a set of instructions designed to guide AI code assistants in generating high-quality, maintainable, and secure code. These instructions provide clear expectations and examples to ensure the AI assistant produces code that aligns with project requirements.

## Purpose

The instructions serve as a reference for interacting with AI code assistants, helping them understand the project's standards and expectations. By providing these guidelines, you can ensure the generated code adheres to best practices and meets your specifications.

## How to Use

### Provide Context: Share relevant sections of the instructions with the AI assistant when requesting code. For example:
   - Use the `core.md` file for general coding practices and architecture guidelines.
   - Refer to `testing-logging.md` for testing and logging standards.
   - Use `python-standards.md` for Python-specific conventions.

### Be Specific: Clearly describe the task and reference the relevant standards. For example:
   - If asking for threading implementation, point to the threading section in `core.md`.
   - For web scraping tasks, reference the web scraping guidelines.
